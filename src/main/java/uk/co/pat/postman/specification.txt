Postman Pat's Special Delivery Service
======================================

Postman Pat has been getting very busy! He is inundated with requests to deliver packages at certain times.
He and his trusty black and white cat Jess need a booking system to be able to manage customer demand. Mrs Goggins
is no longer able to cope!

Important Information (the business rules!)
===========================================

Pat runs his normal daily delivery service (with Jess) to Greendale and Pencaster between the hours of 7am and 9am every day.
This means his Special Delivery Service can only operate between 9am and 4pm, and Pat and Jess take an hour for lunch at 12pm.

Delivery slots are 30 minutes to allow enough time for Pat and Jess to collect packages from Pencaster Mail Centre, deliver it
and then return to the mail centre for the next package.

Requirement
===========

A programmatic interface that provide the necessary behaviour to make delivery bookings, taking into account the business rules
set out above.
